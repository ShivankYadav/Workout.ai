Technology permeates the world, with the AI industry reigning as one of the fastest growing and the intersection of these two industries has created a whole new world of digital fitness.
The Workout.ai is a Personal Workout AI Assistant based on employing AI and computer vision to build a personal fitness trainer. 
The model architecture is based on OpenPose developed by CMU Perceptual Computing Lab. OpenPose represents a real-time multi-person system to jointly detect human body, hand, facial, and foot key points (in total 135 keypoints) on single images.
The assistant will help the user in performing the exercises with maximum efficiency with other added features like Reps, time, calories, etc.
